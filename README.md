# Ethereum Block Explorer

Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about the blockchain including data about:
  * the blockchain network itself
  * blocks in the blockchain
  * transactions in a block
  * accounts
  * and many other things
  
[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a good example of an Ethereum blockexplorer. 

In this project React is used for a front-end and ethers.js  and AlchemySDK for querying the blockchain.
